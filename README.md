# AI-Themed-Website
This is an AI Themed website I made for a competition along with a friend! We used JS, HTML &amp; CSS. Here is the code for it.

It basically talks about AI and it's applications in the real world. It's just 1 webpage since we were limited to only 1 by the organizers. 

We managed to add many cool cosmetic features like the circle following the cursor, the parallax effect, etc.

It was honestly a very fun experience, I got to learn a lot of HTML and CSS, along with a sprinke of JS.

The competition was fun in the end, we unfortunately didn't win.

We used Visual Studio Code and Photoshop for this.
